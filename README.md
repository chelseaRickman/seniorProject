## About the Senior Project
In our Senior Project class, each student (19 students) had to pitch an idea for a project a team of 3-4 students could work on throughout two quarters. From these 19 projects, 6 projects were selected. The photography website was the idea I pitched because I wanted to learn and gain experience with working on a full-stack web application. This project was selected, so two other students and I worked on this project together 

## Technologies
- Frontend: GatsbyJS/React
- Backend: Contentful CMS
- Hosting: Firebase for the frontend, Contentful's hosting for the backend

## Project Description
### What is the project?
Photography website

### Who is the user?
Photographer

### What is being addressed?
The photographer needs a website that does the following:
- Displays their portfolio, contact info, biography, blog posts, photography services/pricing
- Provides a way for customers to contact the photographer
- Allows the photographer to update the content of their website (i.e. upload new photos or blog posts)

## My Contributions to the Project
- Created the page layout on the About, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact pages
- Created the Blog page preview and Customer Reviews components on the Home page
- Created the footer of site that would in theory link to the photographer's personal instagram posts
- Created the "hamburger" navigation menu that appears on smaller screen sizes
- Created the photographer logo (the larger one that appears within the header of the site, and the smaller version that appears within the footer of the site)
- Wrote a fake description of the photographer on the About page
- Implemented a consistent color scheme and fonts used throughout the site
- On the Blog page, fetched data from the Contentful CMS and updated the state of the page using that data dynamically
- Created a team Confluence page to keep track of our project documentation and weekly team reports we needed to submit

## How to Run Program
<p> Currently the frontend (GatsbyJS application) is not deployed, but you can download the code and run the app in development mode locally to view the site</p>

- Go to repo home page: https://github.com/chelseaRickman/seniorProject
- Click on the green "Code" button
- Select "Download ZIP"
- Once the file is downloaded, extract all of the files. 
- From the command-line, navigate to inside of the downloaded folder (should be named something like "seniorProject-main"
- Once inside of that folder, enter the command "gatsby develop"
- This will build the application. Once that is completed, in a browser visit http://localhost:8000 and you can view and navigate through the site
